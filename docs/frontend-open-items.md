### Part 2: God Files — Complete

**Section:** “PART 2: GOD FILES (13 files, ~6,900 lines)”  
**Status:** Done. All substantive god files split into focused hooks/utils; remaining two are re-export shims only.

- ~~`dashboard/hooks/useDashboardController.ts`~~ — **Done:** split into useDashboardSelection, useDashboardData, useDashboardDialogs, useDashboardExports, useDashboardHotkeysConfig; controller ~537 lines, thin composer.
- ~~`help/components/HelpModal.tsx`~~ — **Done:** logic in useHelpModalController + help/utils/helpModalUtils; modal is thin UI shell.
- ~~`settings/useSettingsController.ts`~~ — already thin (~65 lines, composer over sub-hooks).
- ~~`settings/Settings.tsx`~~ — **Done:** logic in useSettingsPage hook; page is thin shell.
- ~~`pages/Test.tsx`~~ — **Done:** logic in Test/hooks (useBlockNoteTestEditor, useFileInputDebug, useTestPageController); page is thin shell.
- ~~`command-palette/components/GlobalCommandPalette.tsx`~~ — **Done:** logic in useGlobalCommandPalette hook; component is thin shell.
- ~~`journal/useJournalController.ts`~~ — **Done:** split into useJournalDialogs, useJournalHotkeysConfig.
- ~~`components/editor/RichEditor.tsx`~~ — **Done:** logic in useRichEditorInner hook; EditorInner is thin shell.
- ~~`pages/document/useDocumentController.ts`~~ — **Done:** split into useDocumentExports, useDocumentHotkeysConfig; controller composes them.
- ~~`utils/paneLayoutUtils.ts`~~ — **Done:** split into paneId, paneTreeQueries, paneTreeMutations, paneLayoutValidation, paneNavigation; paneLayoutUtils is barrel.
- ~~`hotkeys/context/HotkeyContext.tsx`~~ — **Done:** logic in hotkeyMatcher.ts + useHotkeyProviderValue; HotkeyContext is thin provider shell.
- `pages/Projects.tsx`, `pages/Search.tsx` — **N/A:** re-export shims only (~3 lines each); no refactor needed.

**Intent (from review):**
- Split these into smaller, focused modules: data fetching, state machines, view models, and UI shells.
- Reduce mixed concerns (business logic + UI + side effects) and make the code testable.

### Item 14 – Hotkey System Evaluation

**Section:** “14. Custom Hotkey System → Evaluate react-hotkeys-hook”  
**Status:** Done — Mantine removed, manual addEventListener for bubble phase.

**Completed (Phase 1):** Replaced `@mantine/hooks` useHotkeys with manual keydown listener; added `event.preventDefault()` in bubble handler; added Space key normalization in `createHotkeyMatcher`; removed `@mantine/hooks` dependency.

**Context (excerpt):**
- ~~`HotkeyContext.tsx` (~365 lines)~~ Refactored; now uses:
  - Combo parsing (mod/ctrl/shift/alt), priority system, dialog-aware suppression, special character handling, input-field detection, three dispatch phases.
- Assessment: The priority system and dialog-awareness are real needs, but a full custom system might be replaceable with `react-hotkeys-hook` or `tinykeys` plus a thinner wrapper.

### Item 15 – LocalStorage → zustand + persist

**Section:** “15. Custom localStorage Persistence → zustand + persist”  
**Status:** Done.

**Completed:** Migrated all six hooks to zustand + persist stores:
- `commandUsage.store.ts` – command palette usage tracking
- `tooltipUsage.store.ts` – tooltip fade/usage
- `onboarding.store.ts` – welcome overlay state
- `recentDocuments.store.ts` – recent documents list (+ fetch + Events)
- `paneLayout.store.ts` – pane layouts per document
- `progress.store.ts` (pre-existing) – user progress; `useUserProgress` now re-exports from it

Each store uses custom `PersistStorage` for validation, backwards-compatible formats, and optional StorageEvent cross-tab sync. `useLocalStorage` is now unused and can be removed in a future cleanup.

### Item 17 – Plugin Architecture (High-Level)

**Section:** “17. No Plugin Architecture”  
**Status in review:** `Status: [ ] Not started`

**Context (excerpt):**
- Commands, keyboard shortcuts, editor extensions, and themes are all hardcoded.
- For future plugins/customization the app needs:
  - Command registry (done via Item 54),
  - Shortcut registry (config centralization partially done),
  - Theme system and editor plugin interface (still open).

**Remaining work:**
- Define extension points and contracts for plugins (commands, blocks, sidebars, settings).
- Design plugin lifecycle (load, enable/disable, uninstall) and isolation strategy.

---

### Item 18 – Configuration Infrastructure (Phases B–C)

**Section:** “18. Hardcoded Configuration Everywhere”  
**Status in review:** `Status: [x] Partial — refactor/centralize-config (timeouts + layout extracted; Phases B-C pending)`

**Context (excerpt):**
- Phase A: centralize app constants into `config/` (done for shortcuts/timeouts/layout).
- Phase B: load user overrides from a settings file via Wails (not done).
- Phase C: plugin-scoped config namespaces with schema validation (not done).

**Remaining work:**
- Implement user-configurable overrides with persistence and validation.
- Extend config system to support per-plugin namespaces.

---

### Item 29 – Renderless Components → Hooks

**Section:** “29. \"Renderless\" Components”  
**Status:** Done.

**Completed:** Extracted into `useHelpHotkey`, `useQuitHotkeys`, `useWindowHiddenToast`, `useProjectSwitchTracking` in `app/hooks/`. Composed via `useAppGlobalEffects`; single `AppGlobalEffects` component in providers.

---

### Item 30 – Desktop-Specific Concerns

**Section:** “30. Desktop-Specific Concerns”  
**Status:** Done.

**Completed:**
- **Reduced effects mode:** Added “Reduce Visual Effects” toggle in Settings > Appearance. When enabled, sets `data-reduced-effects="true"` on `document.documentElement`; CSS disables `backdrop-filter` and uses nearly opaque glass colors. Persisted via `appearance.store.ts` (zustand + persist).
- **Context menus:** Added Radix-based context menu primitive (`components/ui/context-menu.tsx`). Right-click:
  - **Pane tabs** (PaneHeader): Split horizontally, Split vertically, Close pane
  - **Document rows** (DocumentList): Open, Select/Deselect, Move to..., Archive (or Restore when in archived view)

---

### Item 31–32 – Folder Restructure to Final Domain Layout

**Sections:** “31. Current Structure: Diagnosis”, “32. Proposed Structure”  
**Status:** Complete — All legacy folders (lib/, hooks/, contexts/, components/, constants/, utils/, types/, services/) removed.

**Context (excerpt):**
- Current structure is still partly “technical-role” based (hooks/, contexts/, utils/).
- Proposed structure is a domain-first layout with:
  - `app/`, `dashboard/`, `document/`, `journal/`, `project/`, `search/`, `settings/`, `pane/`, `help/`, `hotkeys/`, etc.
  - A `shared/` layer used only when code is reused across ≥3 domains.

**Completed:**
- **Phase 1:** shared/ui, shared/hooks, shared/utils, shared/types, config/constants
- **Phase 2.1:** pane/components
- **Phase 2.2:** `editor/` domain (RichEditor, extensions, utils/blocknote)
- **Phase 3:** ResizeHandles, TitleBar → app/components
- **Phase 4:** Router imports from domains; `pages/` removed; Test → app/test/
- **Phase 5:** DocumentService → shared/services; legacy shims in place
- **Phase 6 (partial):** Layout imports → @/app; app/providers, app/global-hotkeys import from domains; test mocks updated

**Completed:**
- **Phase 1:** shared/ui, shared/hooks, shared/utils, shared/types, config/constants
- **Phase 2.1:** pane/components
- **Phase 2.2:** `editor/` domain (RichEditor, extensions, utils/blocknote)
- **Phase 3:** ResizeHandles, TitleBar → app/components
- **Phase 4:** Router imports from domains; `pages/` removed; Test → app/test/
- **Phase 5:** DocumentService → shared/services; legacy shims in place
- **Phase 6:** Layout imports → @/app; app/providers, app/global-hotkeys import from domains; test mocks updated
- lib/, hooks/, contexts/, components/, constants/, utils/, types/, services/ all removed
- QuickCommandPanel moved to app/components
- 60+ import paths updated across the codebase

**Post-restructure verification (2026-02-12):**
- Zero legacy import paths remain (`@/components/`, `@/hooks/`, `@/contexts/`, `@/utils/`, `@/types/`, `@/services/`, `@/constants/`, `@/lib/`, `@/pages/` — all clean).
- Barrel files use named exports throughout (except `shared/index.ts` wildcard — tracked in Item 19).
- Code splitting via `React.lazy` correctly applied in `app/Router.tsx` for all route-level pages.
- `tsconfig.json` path aliases minimal and correct (`@/*` → `./src/*`, `@/app` → `./src/app/index`).
- `extensions/index.ts` serves as a compatibility shim re-exporting from `editor/extensions` — acceptable.

**Remaining work:**
- Verify test suite after restructure (deferred).

### Item 19 – Barrel Files (Follow-Up)

**Section:** "19. Add barrel files to all feature dirs"
**Status:** Done (Rev 15), with follow-up needed.

**Completed:** Barrel files added to components/editor, extensions, services, shared.

**Follow-up (from performance review 2025-02-12):**
- `shared/index.ts:1` uses `export * from "./ui"` — wildcard re-export prevents tree-shaking; all ~50 UI components bundled even if only 2 are used. Replace with named exports for only what consumers actually need.
- `shared/hooks/index.ts` — 30+ named hook exports; acceptable since hooks are small, but monitor for unused additions.
- `pane/index.ts` — 30+ exports from pane utilities; acceptable since pane is page-scoped.
- `shared/ui/index.ts` — 50+ component re-exports. Consumers should prefer direct imports (`@/shared/ui/Button`) over barrel imports (`@/shared/ui`) for better tree-shaking.

**Remaining work:**
- Replace `export * from "./ui"` in `shared/index.ts` with explicit named exports.
- Replace `export * from "./primitives"` in `shared/ui/Select/index.ts` with explicit named exports (leaks Select internals).
- Add missing `WithTooltip` export to `shared/ui/index.ts` barrel.

### Item 40 – Effect Waterfalls

**Section:** "40. Split effect waterfalls into focused effects"
**Status:** Done.

**Completed (2026-02-12):**

- **`recentDocuments.store.ts`** — Consolidated from 4 effects to 2; removed redundant local state mirror. Now uses `documents` from the store directly.
- **`app/global-hotkeys.tsx`** — Refactored to use `commandPalette.store.ts`; hotkey binds directly to `open()`/`close()`; removed `isOpen` useState and useEffect.
- **`useDocumentController.ts`** — Added `lastAddedPathRef` guard to prevent duplicate `addRecentDocument` calls when deps change.

---

### Item 49–51 – Performance (Follow-Up)

**Section:** "PART 11: PERFORMANCE DEEP DIVE"
**Status:** Done (Items 49-51 completed), with follow-up findings.

**Follow-up (from performance review 2025-02-12):**

**Inline objects still in render paths:**
- `app/Layout.tsx:113-117` — gradient `backgroundImage` is static and should be hoisted to a CSS class; dynamic `height` style object created every render, hoist to `useMemo` keyed on `heightInRem`.

**Closure chain in callbacks:**
- `shared/hooks/useSidebarSetting.ts:30-46` — `toggleSidebar` → `setSidebarVisible` → `sidebarVisible` cascading deps; callbacks recreated on every state change. Use functional setState to eliminate closures.

**Missing memoization:**
- `document/DocumentPage.tsx` — not wrapped in `React.memo` despite being rendered by Router with changing props.

**O(n) lookups in hot paths:**
- `useDashboardController.ts:306` — `documents.find()` in delete confirmation; use a `Map` for O(1) lookup.
- `useJournalController.ts:204` — `entries.findIndex()` on every entry click; use a `Map`.

**Hotkey system overhead:**
- `useHotkeyProviderValue.ts:51-117` — `useMemo` over all hotkeys depends on `isDialogOpen`, forcing full rebuild when any dialog opens/closes. Split into two memos (hotkey map vs dialog filtering).
- `useHotkeyProviderValue.ts:124-125` — `createHotkeyMatcher()` called inside effect on every render; memoize matchers.

**compareKey optimization defeated:**
- `useDocumentPersistence.tsx:107-109` — `formData.blocks` array in `useMemo` deps causes re-computation even when content is the same (reference equality). The `compareKey` pattern is correct but the dependency should not include the array.

---

### Item 54 – Command Registry (Follow-Up)

**Section:** "54. Command Registry Design"
**Status:** Done (Rev 14), with bug found.

**Bug (from performance review 2025-02-12):**
- `useGlobalCommandPalette.tsx:~150` — `setShowRecentDocuments` is included in the `ctx` object but **missing from the `useMemo` dependency array**. This causes a stale closure: the context object holds a stale reference to `setShowRecentDocuments` after re-renders. Add it to the dependency array.

---

### Item 15 – LocalStorage Stores (Follow-Up)

**Section:** "15. Custom localStorage Persistence → zustand + persist"
**Status:** Done, with schema versioning gap identified.

**Follow-up (from performance review 2025-02-12):**
- `recentDocuments.store.ts` and `commandUsage.store.ts` save raw data without a schema version field. If the schema changes (e.g., adding a `tags` field to recent documents), old data will fail validation silently and be discarded. Add `{ version: 1, ... }` wrapper to storage format.
- `commandUsage.store.ts:41` — `pruneUsageData` sorts entries on every storage write even when under the cap. Only prune when `MAX_ENTRIES` exceeded.

---

### Tier 6 – Extensibility Platform (53a–53d, 14, 15, 18, 30)

**Section:** “Tier 6: Extensibility Platform (planned -- required for roadmap)”  
**Status in review:** all **Not started** (or partial where overlapped with earlier items).

Key items:
- **53a** – Theme system (runtime swap, user-created themes, token architecture).
- **53b** – Plugin architecture (extension registry, loader, lifecycle, sandboxing).
- **53c** – Marketplace (browse/install/update/remove themes/plugins).
- **53d** – i18n foundation (string extraction, locale loading).
- **14, 15, 18, 30** – See sections above; they are explicitly called out as Tier 6 enablers.

**Remaining work:**
- Design and implement the full platform layer for themes, plugins, marketplace, and i18n.
- Integrate the configuration, hotkeys, and state layers so they are ready for plugin-driven extensibility.
